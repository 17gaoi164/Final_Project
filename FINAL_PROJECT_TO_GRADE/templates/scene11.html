        <p> You run downstairs to the main room and lock eyes with the Prince. You step-mom sees you and tells you to go upstais.</p>
        <p> 'Wait!' the Prince says.</p>
        <p> 'She is just our house maid,' your step-mother replies eyeing you up and down.</p>
        <p> 'Let her stay as well' the Prince says.</p>
        <p> 'She hasn't left the house at all this month. She doesn't have to stay,'your step-mother says.</p>
        <p> 'Doesn't matter,' the Prince says coming towards you. He then brings out his hand forward and looks at you. Without thinking too much about your step-mother, you take his hand and he leads you towards the sofa.</p>
        <p> 'Sit,' he says. You obey him. He then order the gaurds to bring the shoe. The guard does so and hands the prince your beautiful shoes that you lost while coming back from the ball.</p>
        <p> The Prince then brings the shoe close to your feet and askes you to put it on. You put on the shoe and it fits perfectly, just like it did during the ball.</p>
        <p> 'Ever since I first laid my eyes on you, I knew I loved you.' the Prince tells you.</p>
        <p> 'Cinderella, will you make me the happiest man alive and marry me?' he asked you'</p>
        <p> You looked around the room and saw your step-mother's angry face. You looked down at the Price. You realized it was your time to make your decision now. </p>
