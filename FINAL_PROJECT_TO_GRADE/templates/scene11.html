        <p> You run downstairs to the main room and lock eyes with the Prince. Your stepmother sees you and tells you to go upstairs.</p>
        <p> 'Wait!' the Prince says.</p>
        <p> 'She is just our house maid,' your step-mother replies eyeing you up and down.</p>
        <p> 'Let her stay as well,' the Prince says.</p>
        <p> 'She hasn't left the house at all this month. She doesn't have to stay,' your step-mother says.</p>
        <p> 'Doesn't matter,' the Prince says coming towards you. He looks at you and puts out his hand. Without thinking too much about your step-mother, you take his hand and he leads you towards the sofa.</p>
        <p> 'Sit,' he says. You obey him. He then orders the guards to bring the shoe. The guard does so and hands the prince your beautiful shoe that you lost while coming back from the ball.</p>
        <p> The Prince then brings the shoe close to your feet and asks you to put it on. You put on the shoe and it fits perfectly, just like it did during the ball.</p>
        <p> 'Ever since I first laid my eyes on you, I knew I loved you.' the Prince tells you.</p>
        <p> 'Cinderella, will you make me the happiest man alive and marry me?' he asks you.'</p>
        <p> You look around the room and see your stepmother's angry face. You look down at the Prince. You realize it's time to make your decision. </p>
